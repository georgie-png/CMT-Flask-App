Mahinya:
- [ ] get it to create a response page that is opened when you hit submit.
- [ ] add the kitchen name selector drop down menu from labels json. (these will be replaced in the future).
- [ ] work the css to get it to look nicer, maybe more rounded divs and nice colour pallet.
- [ ] use [flex box](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) to get the form items to align nicer. Wrapping the key and input in a flex box div with `justify-content` set to `space-around`.
