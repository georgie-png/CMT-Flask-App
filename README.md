To Dos

Mahinya:
- [x] get it to create a response page that is opened when you hit submit.
- [x] add the kitchen name selector drop down menu from kitchen labels json. (these will be replaced in the future).
- [x] work the css to get it to look nicer, maybe more rounded divs and nice colour pallet.
- [x] use [flex box](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) to get the form items to align nicer. Wrapping the key and input in a flex box div with `justify-content` set to `space-around`.
- [ ] improve navigation e.g. add a home button to reciepts pages but also just go beyond and think what to add etc.
- [ ] make it more mobile friendly, maybe another mobile triggered css class that makes fonts/inputs bigger 

George: 
- [x] setup the kitchen load/save data system.
- [x] setup the pickup to ai data pipeline.
