To Dos

Mahinya:
- [x] get it to create a response page that is opened when you hit submit.
- [x] add the kitchen name selector drop down menu from kitchen labels json. (these will be replaced in the future).
- [x] work the css to get it to look nicer, maybe more rounded divs and nice colour pallet.
- [x] use [flex box](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) to get the form items to align nicer. Wrapping the key and input in a flex box div with `justify-content` set to `space-around`.
- [x] improve navigation e.g. add a home button to receipts pages but also just go beyond and think what to add etc.
- [x] make it more mobile friendly, maybe another mobile triggered css class that makes fonts/inputs bigger 
- [x] try to add a display screen to monitor all kitchens values (maybe unlinked). you should be able to us the kitchens array of 'Kitchen' class, and get their 'display_val' (e.g. data.kitchens[0].display_val) and it will return a key val pairing.
- [x] change the html template titles so it displays correctly on the browser tab

George: 
- [x] setup the kitchen load/save data system.
- [x] setup the pickup to ai data pipeline.
- [ ] finish data save/load
